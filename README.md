# First-Data-Science-Project-Flight-Price-Prediction-
This is my first data science project. A machine learning project that predicts flight ticket prices based on airline, source/destination cities, times, stops, class, duration, and days left. Includes EDA, preprocessing, multiple regression models, evaluation, feature importance analysis, and a Streamlit app for interactive predictions.
